# ðŸ’¡ Recommendation System
This project was developed to learning more about how recommendation system works.
This project was divided into:
1. Exploratory analysis of a [base downloaded from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/karkavelrajaj/amazon-sales-dataset/)
2. Recommendation system based on cosine similarity. In this part, I used as reference [this Kaggle page](https://www.kaggle.com/code/nancy248/amazon-sales-analysis)
